`aws-msk-iam-sasl-signer-net` is the AWS MSK IAM SASL Signer for .NET. 

This libary vends encoded IAM v4 signatures which can be used as IAM Auth tokens to authenticate against an MSK cluster. 
 
The AWS MSK IAM SASL Signer for .NET has a target framework of [netstandard2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-0)

## <a name="getting-started"></a> Getting started
To get started working with the AWS MSK IAM SASL Signer for .NET with your Kafka client library please follow below code sample -
 
###### Add Dependencies
 
 AWS MSK IAM SASL SIGNER is distribured via NuGet. We provide the package [AWS.MSK.Auth](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWS.MSK.Auth/) which can be imported via NuGet in your development environment. 
 
###### Write Code
 
For example, you can use the signer library to generate IAM based OAUTH token with [confluent-kafka-dotnet](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet) library as below -
 
 ```cs
    var producerConfig = new ProducerConfig
    {
        BootstrapServers = < BOOTSTRAP - SERVER - HERE >,
        SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocol.SaslSsl,
        SaslMechanism = SaslMechanism.OAuthBearer
    };

    AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator mskAuthTokenGenerator = new AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator();

    //Callback to handle OAuth bearer token refresh. It fetches the OAUTH Token from the AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator class. 
    void OauthCallback(IClient client, string cfg)
    {
        try
        {
            var (token, expiryMs) = await mskAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthTokenAsync(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1);
            client.OAuthBearerSetToken(token, expiryMs, "DummyPrincipal");
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            client.OAuthBearerSetTokenFailure(e.ToString());
        }
    }

    var producer = new ProducerBuilder<string, string>(producerConfig)
                        .SetOAuthBearerTokenRefreshHandler(OauthCallback).Build();
            try
            {
                var deliveryReport = await producer.ProduceAsync("test-topic", new Message<string, string> { Value = "Hello from .NET" });

                Console.WriteLine($"Produced message to {deliveryReport.TopicPartitionOffset}");
            }
            catch (ProduceException<string, string> e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"failed to deliver message: {e.Message} [{e.Error.Code}]");
            }
 ```
 
## More examples of generating auth token
 
### Specifying an alternate credential profile for a client
 
```cs
AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator mskAuthTokenGenerator = new AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator();
var (token, expiryMs) = await mskAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthTokenFromProfileAsync(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1, "profileName");
```
 
### Specifying a role based credential for a client
 
```cs
AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator mskAuthTokenGenerator = new AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator();
var (token, expiryMs) = await mskAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthTokenFromRoleAsync(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1, "roleName", "roleSessioName");
```

Note that roleSessionName is optional here. A default name is used if not specified. This uses the default token expiry, and creates a new STS client for every invocation. 
For higher configurability, use the method mentioned below which takes a credentials provider as an input. This allows you to bring your own credentials for signing the request. 
 
### <a name="credential-provider-method"></a> Specifying AWS Credential Provider for a client
 
```cs
AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator mskAuthTokenGenerator = new AWSMSKAuthTokenGenerator();
var (token, expiryMs) = await mskAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthTokenFromCredentialsProviderAsyc(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1, () => new BasicAWSCredentials("secretKey", "accessKey"));
```
 
## <a name="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting

### <a name="debug-creds"></a> Finding out which identity is being used

When using default credentials, You may receive an Access denied error and there may be some doubt as to which credential is being exactly used. The credential may be sourced from a role ARN, EC2 instance profile, credential profile etc.

You can set the optional parameter awsDebugCreds set to true before getting the token in such cases. 

```cs
var (token, expiryMs) = mskAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthTokenAsync(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1, awsDebugCreds:true);

```

The client library will print a debug log of the form:

```
"Credentials Identity: UserId: ABCD:test124, Account: 1234567890, Arn: arn:aws:sts::1234567890:assumed-role/abc/test124"
```
